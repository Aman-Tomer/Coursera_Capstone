Neighbourhoods of a city can vary greatly based on social, economic & cultural factors. This becomes particularly evident in multicultural cities such as New York City(NYC), Toronto, Paris etc. In this project, I've used the FourSquare API to obtain the most common venue categories in each neighbourhood in Toronto, and then used this feature to group the neighbourhoods into clusters. Thus, anyone planning an excursion, movement or relocation to the city can gauge the neighbourhoods that are similar in terms of the venue categories located in them.

I've used the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, the Folium library has been used to visualize the neighbourhoods in Toronto and their emerging clusters.
